## Team 7 GitHub Repositories:

We have also attached the Admin Panel in the Admin-Panel Branch of this Repository!

[Client Panel Branch](https://github.com/DhruvAthaide/EducationWallah/tree/master)

Because we are using React JS and Firebase, we have separate dependencies and versions for both of the panels, so we have two different repositories for our tech hack problem statement. Therefore, we have presented our Problem Statement on two separate Websites.
